## ACME Store - BJSS academy 2020 UI Sample project

Academy 2021 TODO
- At least part 4 of the challenges has been started, remove. 
- Cypress test not working on WSL2 - Errors around X server type stuff. It's really not growing on me. 


## To get started

Run `npm install` in the command line to install dependencies

Run `npm start` in the command line to start the application listening on http://localhost:3000

## Coding Challenges

You have the afternoon to complete some or all of the following coding challenges.  Don't worry about completing them all or doing thewm in order, I'm more intersted in one well thopught out solution than a series of 'it'll dos'.


1.  Add a modal popup showing detailed product information when a user clicks on a product tile
2.  Change the basket product tile layout to be stacked rather than horizontal tiles
3.  Replace the mock services with calls to a working version of the service
4.  Add a checkout button to the basket page and create the checkout page


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Cypress Tests

In the root directory run these commands:

- npm install
- npm run cypress:open 

The second command will open the Cypress test runner and you can then execute each of the tests which will open Chrome.
